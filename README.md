# Reuters News Sentiment Analysis

Here, I performed a sentiment analysis using 2 approaches on a dataset of 11,228 newswires from Reuters, labeled over 46 topics. 

The idea of this analysis is to create a model that identifies the topic of that particular news based on its context.

### Approach 1: Trained word embedding vector using Word2Vec approach -> Feed into Neural Network 
### Approach 2: Using pre-built Keras word embedding
